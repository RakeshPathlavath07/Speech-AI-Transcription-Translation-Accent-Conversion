## Overview

This project is a **Streamlit application** that demonstrates **end-to-end AI speech processing**. Users can **upload audio files** or **record their voice**, and the app performs the following tasks:

- **Noise Reduction:** Removes background noise from the audio using `librosa` and `noisereduce`.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription:** Converts spoken audio into text using **AssemblyAI**.
- **Translation:** Translates the transcribed text into multiple languages (English, Hindi, Telugu, French, Spanish, German) using free translation APIs.
- **Accent Conversion:** Converts text-to-speech in **selected English accents** (British, American, Australian, Indian) using **Google Cloud TTS**.
- **Read Translated Text:** Speaks the translated text in the **native language voice**, allowing users to hear the text in different accents or languages.
